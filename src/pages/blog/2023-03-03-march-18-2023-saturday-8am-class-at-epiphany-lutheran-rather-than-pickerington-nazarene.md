Saturday 8am class (March 18, 2023, only) will be at Epiphany Lutheran, 268 Hill Road North, Pickerington, OH 43147 rather than Pickerington Nazarene. We will continue Saturday 8am classes at Pickerington Nazarene, 11775 Pickerington Road, Pickerington, OH 43147 all other Saturday dates through March and April. We will be going outside for Yoga in the Park effective May 1, 2023, and meeting at Victory Park, across the road from Pickerington City Hall at 100 Lockville Road, Pickerington, Oh 43147. Rain or shine, we'll be there! We have a shelter house where we can move the picnic tables out of the way for our class and be dry! We will continue outdoor classes through September 2023. Stay tuned right here to find out where we will meet after September 30th.
