Fï»¿ree yoga is exactly that... free to the community with no obligation in any way whatsoever; however, if you'd like to bring a donation of some kind to our event, you're welcome to do that and I'll make sure it gets to where it belongs. These classes are open to the public and all are welcome. This is a "beginning yoga" class and intended to help with stretching, stress relief, and mind-body connection. Please bring a yoga mat but if you don't have one, come anyway as I usually have an extra one or two. Some kneeling is involved so bring a thick towel and some pressure is required on your hands in the "down dog" position so feel free to modify to your elbows if that works better for you.  

Cash donations go to the church in which we are having the event to help pay for lighting or other expenses involved in getting us into the building. If you bring food pantry donations, I'll make sure those get to the Pickerington Food Pantry. If you bring used eyeglasses or used medicine bottles (red, blue or green), I'll make sure those get to the Pickerington Lions Club along with any used grocery bags or plastics like bubble wrap, fresh produce bags, bread bags, water bottle shrink wrap, etc. I will also collect aluminum pop tabs for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. I have collection containers at every class for your convenience. 

Please be sure to sign in each time you come as we are keeping track of attendance, and we need your assistance in confirming no liability for offering these free classes. Any questions or comments can be directed to the instructor, Darlene Kuzmic, or her authorized representative teaching the class. 614-531-2050 or email darlenekuzmic@gmail.com. Thank you!
