I would like to thank the Violet Township Fire station at 8700 Refugee Rd. in Pickerington for assisting us with Free Yoga today! Due to unforeseen circumstances with the other locations, the firemen stepped right in! They moved a truck out and let us use their bay for our yoga class today! How unbelievably kind and what an amazing experience!

I am giving a donation to the Violet Township Fire Department as thanks for their assistance today, but cannot thank them enough!
